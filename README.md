# ERC20 Token

The ERC20 contract for our custom token was built by inheriting from the Openzeppelin contract.


## Features

- This allows for easy implementation of the core functionality such as buying, minting, withdrawing, and burning tokens.
- The contract was thoroughly tested using MOCHA and CHAI to ensure its stability and security before deployment. 
- The deployment process was done using hardhat on a local node and a gas report was generated using hardhat-gas-reporter to monitor the cost of the deployment.
- Additionally, Coinmarketcap API was used to calculate the gas cost.
